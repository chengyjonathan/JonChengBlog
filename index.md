I got a PhD in English, focusing on Machine Learning and British books in the 1800s.

Spent some time using computers to highlight historical trends about fictional people.

After that, I worked at Apple, working on recommendation systems.

Soon, I'll be working at Riot Games.

But, in the back of my mind, I think about how Data Science/ML could affect the humanities (and the university).
